Module 4
1. Proton 
2. Allow electricity to flow easily , Are made of atoms whose electrons are loosely bound and free to move through the material 
3. Power
4. P= E*I
5. Path and Load 
6. It changes the polarity of its terminal over time , most common source of power
7. Measured in VAR air KVAR , Power is both +,-
8. True power divided by apparent power 
9. Generator
10. Voltage is same , power is equal to total power consumed which is equal to sum of power consumed by each component 
11. Farad
12. The ability of a material to allow electrons to flow
13. Copper
14. Raceways, flexible metal and liquid tight 
15. It is backbone of power distribution in a data center , highly reliable , safe for operating under normal conditions
16. Handle higher loads , suitable for industrial and commercial use, delivers power at a steady and constant rate
17. Changes polarity with time , changes direction periodically , is easy to covert
18. Utility providers use it to distribute power over long distances , current flow is inversely proportional to voltage, Transforms â€¦ 
19. Prevents damage to the system caused by over current 
20. Analyse the power in a facility , Report problems such as transients and harmonics
